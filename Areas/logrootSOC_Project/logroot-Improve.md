Modern SIEMs have made great strides in cybersecurity, but they still have several limitations that can make them challenging for SOC analysts. Here's a look at what is often missing from modern SIEMs and how you can address those gaps in your project:

### What’s Missing from Modern SIEMs:

1. **User-Friendly Interfaces**:
    - **Problem**: Many SIEMs have cluttered or complex interfaces, which can overwhelm analysts and slow down investigations.
    - **Solution**: Focus on designing a clean, intuitive dashboard in your project where analysts can quickly access important features like log analysis, module execution, and incident alerts.
2. **Customizable Correlation Rules**:
    - **Problem**: SIEMs often come with prebuilt detection rules, but customizing these to an organization’s specific needs can be cumbersome.
    - **Solution**: Incorporate a flexible rule engine that allows SOC analysts to create and modify correlation rules easily. Giving them the ability to write rules in a language like the Wazuh Query Language (which you’re working on) can make threat detection more adaptable.
3. **Automated Response Capabilities**:
    - **Problem**: While many SIEMs detect threats well, the automated response mechanisms are often limited or not user-friendly.
    - **Solution**: Build in options for automated responses, such as isolating a host, terminating suspicious processes, or alerting teams via multiple channels (email, Slack, SMS). Adding flexibility here can significantly reduce response times.
4. **Better Integration with Cloud Environments**:
    - **Problem**: Many SIEMs still struggle to monitor cloud-native environments or hybrid architectures efficiently.
    - **Solution**: If your project is intended to monitor Windows environments, consider integrating with cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, so logs from these platforms can be easily collected and analyzed.
5. **Contextual Awareness**:
    - **Problem**: Modern SIEMs often lack context, which means SOC analysts might get alerts without understanding the full context of an event (e.g., why a file was flagged or how it fits into a larger attack chain).
    - **Solution**: You can integrate more detailed metadata with each log or alert—such as details about the system, the user involved, recent actions, and network context. Adding machine learning or behavior-based analytics can further enhance contextual understanding.
6. **False Positive Management**:
    - **Problem**: SIEMs are notorious for generating false positives, leading to alert fatigue among SOC analysts.
    - **Solution**: Introduce machine learning algorithms or customizable thresholds that learn from analyst feedback, reducing the number of false positives over time. Integrating some form of dynamic alert tuning based on analyst interaction can improve efficiency.
7. **Incident Investigation and Root Cause Analysis Tools**:
    - **Problem**: Some SIEMs make it hard for SOC analysts to conduct thorough investigations or pinpoint the root cause of incidents.
    - **Solution**: Make sure your project supports drill-downs from alerts into associated logs, related events, and even external threat intelligence. Create visualizations that map out incident timelines and show the relationships between events, users, and systems.
8. **Efficient Log Storage and Retrieval**:
    - **Problem**: Log storage can be costly and slow in many SIEMs, making it hard to investigate historical events quickly.
    - **Solution**: Your Elasticsearch-based system already helps with fast indexing and searching. Consider optimizing storage and search efficiency further by implementing data retention policies, archiving older logs, and making retrieval faster for SOC analysts.
9. **Collaboration Tools**:
    - **Problem**: SOC teams often need to collaborate on incidents, but many SIEMs don’t provide built-in collaboration features.
    - **Solution**: You could add features that allow SOC analysts to annotate logs, share incidents with team members, and assign tasks directly within the dashboard.
10. **Threat Hunting and Proactive Monitoring**:
    - **Problem**: Many SIEMs are reactive and only alert when rules are triggered.
    - **Solution**: Build proactive monitoring tools that enable analysts to hunt for threats. You could integrate modules that help them search for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) and trends within the data, providing capabilities for both reactive and proactive defenses.

### How to Make Your Project More Usable for SOC Analysts:

1. **Modular Design**:
    - Keep your system modular, where different modules can be added or removed depending on the organization's needs. This flexibility will allow SOC analysts to choose what’s most relevant to their environment, whether it's log collection, threat detection, or vulnerability management.
2. **Customization Options**:
    - Allow for easy customization of alerts, reports, and workflows. SOC teams often need to adjust their tools to fit their unique environment, so providing flexibility is essential.
3. **Clear Documentation and Onboarding**:
    - Provide extensive documentation and easy onboarding for new analysts. Since you're building your own system from scratch, ensure that it’s well-documented so that SOC teams can quickly adopt it. Creating step-by-step guides, in-app tutorials, or interactive demos would help.
4. **Real-Time and Historical Data Views**:
    - Ensure that SOC analysts can easily toggle between real-time data and historical logs. This feature will allow for faster investigations and make it easier to spot long-term patterns.
5. **Streamlined Alerting and Reporting**:
    - Provide clear, actionable alerts that are categorized by severity and contain all relevant information. Allow analysts to customize reports and schedule them based on the specific needs of the SOC.
6. **Integration with Existing Tools**:
    - Many SOC teams rely on multiple tools. Ensure your project can integrate with tools like ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow), vulnerability scanners, and asset management platforms. This will increase the chances of adoption by SOC teams.

By addressing some of these pain points and focusing on ease of use, customization, and proactive monitoring, your project could become an invaluable tool for SOC analysts and security teams.
