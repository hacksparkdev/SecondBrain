### Step-by-Step Guide to Build Your SOC Analyst Project

### **1. Project Planning and Overview**

Before writing any code, you need to define the goals of your project. You want a system that can:

- Display real-time Windows Event Logs on a dashboard.
- Allow users to specify which event logs they want to monitor.
- Efficiently store and search logs in Elasticsearch.
- Let users write and run custom modules.
- Create custom alerts based on logs and notify users in real-time.
- Provide IOC and threat-hunting capabilities.

This project will showcase your ability to work with real-time log collection, data storage, querying, threat detection, and SOC automation.

### **2. Realtime Windows Event Logs Feed**

**Objective:** Set up a system that can collect Windows Event Logs in real-time and allow users to select specific logs they want to view.

### **Steps:**

1. **Log Collection Setup:**
    - **Windows Event Logs**: Use Windows APIs (like `win32evtlog`) or a logging framework (e.g., `NXLog` or `Winlogbeat`) to collect Windows event logs.
    - **Log Type Customization**: Allow the user to choose which logs they want to collect (e.g., Security, Application, System).
    - **Polling Strategy**: Implement a mechanism that continuously monitors the event logs in real time, capturing new events as they come in.
2. **Event Filtering:**
    - Provide an interface where users can specify criteria for the event logs they want to monitor (e.g., event IDs, keywords).
    - Implement filtering either at the source (before sending logs) or at the dashboard level (display only filtered logs).
3. **Real-time Data Feed:**
    - Use [**Socket.io**](http://socket.io/) (Node.js) to send logs from the server to the browser in real-time.
    - Ensure the front-end can display the live feed in a structured and clean way, e.g., using tables or real-time charts.
4. **Dashboard Display:**
    - Design a responsive UI for displaying logs in real-time.
    - Add options for filtering, sorting, and searching within the logs on the dashboard.

### **3. Setting Up Elasticsearch**

**Objective:** Create a highly optimized Elasticsearch setup for storing, querying, and analyzing logs.

### **Steps:**

1. **Install Elasticsearch:**
    - Set up a fresh Elasticsearch instance either on a local machine or in the cloud (Elastic Cloud, AWS, etc.).
    - Configure the Elasticsearch node to handle logs efficiently, focusing on performance and reliability.
2. **Index Design:**
    - Use time-based indices for log storage (e.g., `logs-YYYY-MM-DD`), which allows for efficient querying and archiving.
    - Pre-define mappings for fields like `timestamp`, `hostname`, `eventID`, `source`, `message`, etc., to optimize search and aggregation queries.
3. **Elasticsearch Mappings and Templates:**
    - Create index templates to automatically apply mappings when a new index is created.
    - Include common field types like `keyword` for exact matches, `date` for timestamps, and `text` for full-text search.
4. **Index Lifecycle Management (ILM):**
    - Set up ILM policies to manage index rollover, archiving, and deletion of old data.
    - Define lifecycle stages (e.g., hot, warm, cold) to handle logs based on age and usage.
5. **Optimization:**
    - Optimize shard sizes, replication, and search performance based on expected query patterns.
    - Use field exclusions and document compression to reduce storage costs.

### **4. User-Defined Modules**

**Objective:** Enable users to create, manage, and run custom Python modules for log analysis and automation.

### **Steps:**

1. **User Interface for Modules:**
    - Create a dashboard page where users can upload or write their own Python modules.
    - Each module should follow a standard structure, with a `run()` function that the system can execute.
2. **Module Execution Engine:**
    - Design a Python worker that polls Elasticsearch for tasks (modules to run), executes the module, and returns results to Elasticsearch.
    - Enable users to specify which logs or datasets the module should process (e.g., filtering logs by hostname or time range).
3. **Security and Isolation:**
    - Ensure each user module runs in a sandboxed environment to avoid potential security risks.
    - Implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for module execution to prevent misuse.

---

### **5. Custom Alerts System**

**Objective:** Allow users to define custom alerts based on log data, with real-time notifications when conditions are met.

### **Steps:**

1. **Alert Definitions:**
    - Create an interface where users can define alerts based on log conditions (e.g., specific event IDs, keywords, thresholds).
    - Support common alert types such as failed login attempts, user creation, or suspicious activity.
2. **Alert Monitoring Engine:**
    - Set up a background service that continuously checks logs for conditions that match user-defined alerts.
    - Store active alerts in Elasticsearch with clear details about when and why they were triggered.
3. **Notification System:**
    - Implement a notification system using tools like [**Socket.io**](http://socket.io/) for real-time browser alerts.
    - Integrate with **ntfy** or email/SMS notifications to alert users when their conditions are met.

### **6. IOC Threat Hunting**

**Objective:** Provide tools for users to search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in logs and perform advanced threat hunting.

### **Steps:**

1. **IOC Database Integration:**
    - Integrate a threat intelligence feed (e.g., MISP, VirusTotal) to query known IOCs like IP addresses, hashes, or domains.
    - Provide a method to enrich event logs with IOC data, flagging potentially malicious activity.
2. **IOC Search Interface:**
    - Add a section to the dashboard where users can manually search for IOCs within the log data (e.g., search logs for suspicious IPs).
    - Allow for advanced filters and queries to hunt for threats in real-time or historical data.
3. **Automated Threat Detection:**
    - Implement rules-based or machine learning-based modules that automatically flag suspicious activity based on IOCs.
    - Store detected threats in Elasticsearch and notify users when a potential compromise is found.

### **7. Additional Features to Enhance the Project**

**A. Visualization and Reporting:**

- Use chart libraries (e.g., **Chart.js**, **D3.js**) to create real-time visualizations of log activity.
- Build reporting features where users can generate PDFs or export data based on log insights and analysis.

**B. Playbooks for Automated Responses:**

- Allow users to define playbooks for automated incident response. For example, when a critical alert is triggered, automatically run specific modules or scripts to gather additional data or mitigate the issue.

**C. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

- Implement RBAC so that different users have different levels of access to logs, modules, and system settings.
- Admins can define permissions for who can view logs, set alerts, or run modules.

---

### **8. Testing and Documentation**

**Objective:** Make sure everything works as intended, and document the project thoroughly.

### **Steps:**

1. **Test Each Component:**
    - Set up test environments for each part of the project (log collection, module execution, alerting, etc.).
    - Use mock data to ensure real-time log collection, filtering, and querying work as expected.
2. **Documentation:**
    - Write clear documentation for how to install, configure, and use each component of the project.
    - Include examples and screenshots of the dashboard, logs, and alerts.

---

### **9. Deployment and Hosting**

**Objective:** Deploy the system so users can access it easily.

### **Steps:**

1. **Deploy Backend and Frontend:**
    - Use a service like **Docker** to containerize your Elasticsearch, Python worker, and Node.js server.
    - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) with proper security settings (e.g., firewall, SSL).
2. **Public Access to Dashboard:**
    - Host the dashboard with a service like **Heroku**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, or **Netlify**.
    - Set up proper user authentication (OAuth or JWT) to ensure secure access.
