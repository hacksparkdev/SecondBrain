Given your project's scope and the need for real-time log collection, alerting, and modular execution of user-defined Python modules, a **modular architecture** would be the most effective. This will ensure maintainability, scalability, and ease of extension as your project evolves. Here’s a breakdown of how to structure the code, folders, and key components.

### **1. Code Architecture: Modular Design**

- **Modular Design** is best suited for a project that has multiple distinct functionalities (log collection, alerting, running Python modules, etc.). Each feature should be a separate module that can function independently but integrates into the overall system. You can think of it as separating concerns, where each module has a single responsibility.

### **Core Components**

1. **Winlogbeat/Log Collection Module**: Handles the collection of logs from Windows Event Logs, using Winlogbeat or Python if necessary. It collects, filters, and forwards logs to Logstash.
2. **Log Processing (Logstash)**: Configured to parse and enrich logs, and forward them to Elasticsearch.
3. **Elasticsearch Interface**: Responsible for storing and retrieving logs from Elasticsearch. This would be a service that can be called by other components, such as the dashboard and custom module execution.
4. **User-Defined Modules**: A directory where users can upload their custom Python modules to be executed against specific log data. Each module should follow a defined structure (e.g., it must have a `run()` function).
5. **Dashboard/UI**: A Node.js-based web interface that interacts with Elasticsearch and handles real-time log visualization, search, alerts, and management of user modules.
6. **Alerting System**: A separate service or module responsible for defining and triggering alerts based on specific log conditions or events.
7. **Security Features**: Implement authentication and authorization, likely using JWT or OAuth, for accessing the dashboard, running modules, and managing alerts.

### **2. Folder Structure**

Your folder structure should reflect this modular design, keeping each responsibility isolated for ease of development and testing.

### **Example Folder Structure**

```

```

### **3. Key Components and Their Responsibilities**

### **A. Log Collection**

- **Winlogbeat Configuration**: Store `winlogbeat.yml` in the `/config` folder. This will define which logs to collect and where to send them.
- **Custom Python Module (Optional)**: If you’re using a Python-based log collector instead of Winlogbeat, the `log_collector.py` in `/scripts` can be designed to poll event logs and send them to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

### **B. Log Processing with Logstash**

- **Logstash Configuration**: `logstash.conf` in the `/config` directory defines how logs should be parsed, filtered, and enriched before being sent to Elasticsearch.
    - This should include any enrichment tasks (e.g., adding geo-location or MISP threat intelligence).
    - Logs are then forwarded to Elasticsearch for indexing.

### **C. Elasticsearch Interface**

- **Elasticsearch Queries**: The `/services/elasticsearch` directory will contain all Python or Node.js code that interacts with Elasticsearch:
    - **elastic_query.py**: Handles basic queries to fetch logs, search for specific events, or retrieve log summaries.
    - **index_manager.py**: Manages index creation, rotation, and ILM policies.

### **D. User Modules**

- **Modular Python Scripts**: The `/modules` folder contains Python scripts written by the user, each designed to analyze or process specific log data.
- **Module Runner**: The `/services/module_runner/worker.py` will:
    - Poll for tasks in Elasticsearch (or trigger them from the UI).
    - Load user-defined modules and execute them.
    - Send the results back to Elasticsearch or directly to the dashboard.

### **E. Dashboard (Node.js)**

- **Real-Time Logs**: Your `server.js` should handle [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) to stream real-time logs from Elasticsearch to the front-end.
    - The `/views/logs.ejs` would display these logs in real time.
- **Alerts UI**: The `alerts.ejs` in `/views` would allow users to set up custom alerts based on log data.
- **Module Management**: The `/views/modules.ejs` page would allow users to upload new Python scripts and view the output from executed modules.

### **F. Alerts**

- **Alert Definitions**: Store user-defined alerts in Elasticsearch, and the `/services/alerts` will contain the logic to periodically query Elasticsearch for any alert-triggering conditions (e.g., failed logins, user creation).
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications can be implemented using [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) or through a service like **ntfy** to send browser alerts or notifications through other means (email, Slack, etc.).

### **4. Coding Strategy**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module or service should have a single responsibility (e.g., log collection, log storage, or alerting), making it easier to debug and extend.
- **RESTful API**: Use Node.js as a middleware to expose an API to the front-end for interacting with Elasticsearch. This way, users can trigger module execution, search logs, or set alerts through the UI.
- **Python Worker**: Create a Python worker script (e.g., `/services/module_runner/worker.py`) that runs continuously and handles module execution.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Use WebSockets ([Socket.io](http://socket.io/)) in Node.js for real-time log updates and alerts.
- **Test Coverage**: Add tests for critical modules in `/tests` to ensure reliability when users write their own modules.

### **5. Additional Considerations**

- **Security**: Implement authentication (JWT or OAuth) for accessing the dashboard and running sensitive modules.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure the Python worker that executes user modules has resource limits (CPU, memory) to prevent abuse.
- **Documentation**: Ensure you have a well-documented `README.md` explaining how each part of the system works, especially for people wanting to write custom modules.

### **Summary**

1. **Modular Design**: Each component (log collection, module execution, alerting, dashboard) is separated into its own service or module.
2. **Folder Structure**: Organized by functionality (e.g., modules, services, logs) to keep things clean and maintainable.
3. **Node.js Dashboard**: Acts as the front-end for visualizing logs, setting alerts, and running modules.
4. **Python Worker**: Handles the execution of custom modules, reading logs from Elasticsearch, and passing results back to the dashboard.

By using a **modular architecture** and separating concerns in your project, you can ensure that it scales well, is maintainable, and can be extended in the future. This structure will also make it easier for other users or developers to contribute to the project.
